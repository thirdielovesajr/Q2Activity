	<p><span id="external">I've been so good</span>, I've been helpful and friendly
	   I've been so good, why am I feeling empty?
	   I've been so good, I've been so good this year
	   I've been so good, but it's still getting harder
	   I've been so good, where the hell is the <span>karma?</span>
	   I've been so good, I've been so good this year</p>

	<p>To give me some diagnosis of why I'm so hollow
	   Please give me instructions, I promise I'll follow
	   I tripped on my ankle and fractured my elbow
	   But doesn't that mean that the tour's gonna sell though?
	   I try to explain the good faith that's been wasted
	   But after an hour it sounds like complaining
	   Wait don't go away, can I lie here forever?
	   You say that I'm better, why don't I feel better?
	   The universe works in mysterious ways
	   But I'm starting to think it ain't working for me
	   Doctor, should I be good?
	   Should I be good this year?</p>
